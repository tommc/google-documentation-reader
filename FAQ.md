# Frequently Asked Questions #

### Search results aren't including some of my recent content.  Why? ###
The documentation reader uses Google search, and it may take some time before new pages are indexed and incorporated into search results.

### Can I mix documents from other places on the web, not only projects hosted on Google Code, into my documentation? ###
Not in the table of contents, no. All of the pages in your Table Of Contents need to come from the project's wiki. You can, of course, have outgoing links from any wiki page to external pages.
