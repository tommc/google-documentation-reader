# Take your documentation offline! #

With the upcoming release of Google Code documentation reader, you'll be able to get the documentation you need to get stuff done, even while you're offline! Harnessing the power of [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com), you'll never have to be without docs.

# What? #

Really! Just install [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com), load up the documentation you want to save, and hit "Offline". Soon you'll have a local, searchable, browseable copy of all your important docs! Then, when you're back on the Internet, hit "Go online" and act like nothing happened.
