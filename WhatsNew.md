## What's New for Google Code documentation reader? ##

These are notes about the [Google Code documentation reader](http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-documentation-reader), the interface you've been using to read documentation on Google Code.

To correspond with the launch of [Google Web Toolkit 1.5](http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-web-toolkit-doc-1-5), we've revamped the documentation reader. You may notice some improvements, including faster load times, a cleaner UI, and better handling of links in documents, and a [new format for URLs](UrlFormat.md) (the old one still works too!). Hopefully, though, the interface will get right out of the way and you can just read the documents you want :)

[Google Doctype](http://code.google.com/doctype) is now live and using the documentation reader! Welcome, Doctype users :)

You can use the documentation reader with other Google Code projects too! For any project hosted on Google Code that has a wiki, just head over to `http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(your-project)`.

And if you have your own project on Google Code, it's quick and easy to [spruce up your table of contents and index](http://code.google.com/docreader/#p(google-documentation-reader)s(google-documentation-reader)t(TipsForAuthors)) for use with the documentation reader.

This is our first release, so...everything's new! We can offer some useful starting points, though.

### For Readers ###
  * The 'h' key reveals a keyboard help reminder. The rest of the shortcut keys are described there.
  * You can bookmark a topic at any time using your browser's normal "bookmark" command.
  * External links are designed with a small arrow. Following such links will navigate you away from the documentation view, but you can return easily by simply using normal browser navigation (back button, history, etc.).
  * You can view multiple set of documentation together in a single view by including multiple projects in a [custom URL](UrlFormat.md).

### For Authors ###
  * As explained in the [tips for authors](TipsForAuthors.md) section, you can make your project viewable with the documentation viewer by simply adding a wiki page named `TableOfContents`. To include index terms, add a wiki page named `Index`.
  * If you are signed into a project whose doc you are viewing, topics will have an "Edit" link, making it easy to edit the wiki page underlying each topic.
