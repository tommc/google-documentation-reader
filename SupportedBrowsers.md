We expect the documentation reader to work with any modern browser.  We specifically test with:
  * Internet Explorer 6 and 7 (Windows)
  * Firefox 2 and 3 (Linux, Mac, and Windows)
  * Safari 3 (Mac)
  * Opera 9.5 (Mac and Windows)
  * Google Chrome

If you have any problems, though, feel free to [put in a bug report](http://code.google.com/p/google-documentation-reader/issues/list).
