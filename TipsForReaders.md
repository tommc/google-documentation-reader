# Reading Documentation #

The documentation reader should feel familiar, much like other libraries and help systems you may have used. Our goal is to provide great performance, like local storage options, with the quick updates of an online system.

One feature that may be unfamiliar, however -- you can [make your own URLs](UrlFormat.md) to mix-and-match the projects you use often. Bookmark them and share with your friends! The documentation reader will make it easy for recipients not only to look at what you sent them, but also to find the context from other documentation around it.

If you prefer a more unstructured appearance for documentation and want to use search to find what you want, then hide the navigation area. You'll still only be searching through the documentation you asked for. If, however, you prefer a more structured navigation, it's there. Do whatever suits your workstyle and tastes.

Finally, if you find something wrong or missing, remember that the pages are stored in code.google.com's project wikis.  Either send the bug report to the members of that project, or consider offering to join the project so you can fix issues yourself.  Most projects will value documentation contributions at least as much as code contributions, and it can be a great way to get started understanding the code as well if you want to involve yourself more!
